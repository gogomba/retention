The data available are sales of season tickets to an amusement park. The data consist of season ticket pass sales (with values of 1 or 0), on the basis of two factors: the channel used to extend the offer (email, postal mail, or in-person at the park) and whether it was promoted in a bundle offering the season ticket with another feature such as free parking, or not. We shall use logistic regression to answer the following marketing question: are customers more likely to purchase the season pass when it is offered in the bundle (with free parking), or not? # multivariate analysis and basic descriptive statistics library(psych) # data processing library(dplyr) library(tidyverse) library(data.table) library(DT) # plot library(ggplot2) library(corrplot) library(ggthemes) library(ggridges) # rMarkdown library(rmarkdown) library(kableExtra) # file path management library(here) # stat library(factoextra) "],["explorative-data-analysis.html", "Chapter1 Explorative Data Analysis", " Chapter1 Explorative Data Analysis # data dataPath = file.path(dataDir, &quot;pass.csv&quot;) pass = read.csv(dataPath) # show DT::datatable( pass, rownames = F, fillContainer = T, options = list( pageLength = 10, scrollX = TRUE, scrollY = TRUE ) ) "],["404.html", "Page not found", " Page not found The page you requested cannot be found (perhaps it was moved or renamed).
